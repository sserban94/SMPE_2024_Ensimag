# MOOC

## Module 1

- Write notes with dates and number the notes (especially in case of writing on paper – which of course is not at all the best option).
- Tidy up notes after finishing. Even wrong tracks can be useful – if they lead to the right conclusions.
- Organize notes for ease of access and index.
- Keep references as well, articles used, URLs, and so on.
- Besides notes we should write down summaries, quotes.
- Careful with document names. They should be suggestive, easy to find.

## Tips

- Use text files – UTF8 encoded files. Always easy to read with text editors (e.g., Notepad++).
- Lightweight markup languages – mix between text files and markup languages (text files ease of use, markup langs better reading):
  - Markdown language
  - Wikitext
  - AsciiDoc
  - ReStructuredText
- Best combo – lightweight markup language + VCS such as Git:
  - Can see details such as history of modifications.
  - Easy to add contributors to the same notes.
- Use desktop search engines such as DocFetcher to find keywords in multiple files.
- In Markdown – use comments as labels (these aren’t displayed, but can be used for searching purposes).
- Image files also contain metadata which can be displayed.
